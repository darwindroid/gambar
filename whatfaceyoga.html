<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>What Is Face Yoga?</strong></h2>
<p style="text-align: center;">First things first: Face yoga doesn&rsquo;t involve the usual shavasana or Downward-Facing Dog poses you&rsquo;re familiar with from your yoga practice. &ldquo;Yoga&rdquo; is just a catchy way to say facial exercises that move the muscles on your face into certain positions &mdash; kind of like yoga for your body. The idea is that performing these exercises will keep your face looking toned and young, lifting areas that are sagging and drooping, and trimming years from your visage.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">&ldquo;The aim is to create a moment of self-care where you improve blood circulation for a healthy glow and reduce stress and tension in your face,&rdquo; says&nbsp;Elsa Jungman, PhD, a scientist, microbiome expert, and&nbsp;proponent of facial yoga&nbsp;based in San Francisco.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Most people hold tension in their faces, whether through facial expressions or too much time in front of a screen. &ldquo;All these daily activities cause patterns in how we use our face and the specific muscles we recruit,&rdquo; Dr. Jungman says. &ldquo;This is why we want to focus more on releasing and softening our faces to let go of these patterns and any held facial tension.&rdquo;</p>
