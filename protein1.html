Recipe Notes

While you don’t have to use a frozen banana for this protein shake, I recommend it because it will make the texture creamier and thicker and will make it so you don’t have to use much, if any extra ice which will dilute the flavor.  I like to freeze bananas ahead of time using re-usable silicone bags, which are awesome and store food really well.  These are the ones I use.

If you'd like to enjoy this protein shake, but you don't care for banana or you're allergic, you can easily replace with any frozen fruit of your choice.  Some great options include: cherries, strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, avocado, pineapple, mangoes, raspberries, or a mix of any of these.

You can also easily omit the greek yogurt if you're non-dairy.  While it does add valuable nutrients and creaminess to the texture, it can easily be made without it or with a vegan substitute, like coconut yogurt or another plant-based yogurt.
