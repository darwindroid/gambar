<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Touted Benefits of Face Yoga</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Facial yoga is said to help counter those effects. According to two popular programs,&nbsp;Happy Face Yoga&nbsp;and&nbsp;Face Yoga Method, face yoga helps to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Release tension, which can minimize the appearance of stress lines</li>
<li>Strengthen and tone facial muscles to ultimately widen eyes, raise cheeks, and firm up the jawline</li>
<li>Increase circulation and blood flow to the skin, which makes the skin glow</li>
<li>Smooth fine lines and wrinkles</li>
<li>Counter the effects of gravity</li>
<li>Reduce the appearance of scars</li>
</ul>
<p>Some dermatologists say there&rsquo;s some truth to these claims. &ldquo;The goal of face yoga is to increase the blood and oxygen supply to your skin, which improves the life of the cell,&rdquo; says Deborah Longwill, DO, a board-certified dermatologist at&nbsp;Miami Center for Dermatology&nbsp;in Florida and cofounder of&nbsp;Doctor's Daughter Skincare. &ldquo;This leads to glowing and rejuvenated skin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy Chen, MD, a board-certified&nbsp;dermatologist with Riverchase Dermatology in Miami, also says you could reduce visible signs of aging by toning the muscles through specific facial exercise training.</p>
<p>It should be noted, though, that there isn&rsquo;t much research about facial yoga or facial exercises. The most promising and most-often-cited support comes from&nbsp;research published in March 2018 in&nbsp;<em>JAMA Dermatology</em>. In the study, a group of participants ages 40 to 65 performed facial exercises for 30 minutes a day for eight weeks. Then for 12 more weeks, they practiced the exercises three to four times per week. At the end of the 20 weeks, the study participants saw improved upper and lower cheek fullness. They also looked younger at the end of the study, with two dermatologists estimating the participants&rsquo; average age was 50.8 years old at the start of the study and 48.1 years 20 weeks later.</p>
<p>You shouldn&rsquo;t expect drastic changes, though. The&nbsp;<em>JAMA Dermatology</em>&nbsp;study authors noted that their participant sample was small and the results were modest. And keep in mind that face exercises won&rsquo;t alter the texture of your skin,&nbsp;according to Harvard Health, though moving and stretching scarred skin through face yoga can lessen the appearance of scars.</p>
