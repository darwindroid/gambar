Recipe Variations

Other protein powders will work for this recipe, but you won't have the chocolaty flavor. Try vanilla powder for a slightly nutty and sweet shake.
If you're using peanut butter instead of peanut powder, you can swap it for almond butter or cashew butter.
Old-fashioned oats are also known as rolled oats. Quick-cooking oats will also work, just measure out slightly less. Note that old-fashioned oats are slightly healthier since they contain a little more fiber and protein per cup than instant oats.
You could also add a small frozen ripe banana to this recipe instead of the ice cubes. Just add a little more milk so the shake is not too thick. Bananas make a great shake thickener and are a nice natural sweetener too. Keep in mind that your protein powder might have quite a bit of sweetener already.
Tips
This protein shake can be kept in an airtight container in the fridge for a few days, but it will be more watery and some separation will occur. Stir well before drinking.
Peanut powder is lower in fat than peanut butter, making it a great option for a shake.
