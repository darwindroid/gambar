If it feels like you are holding all of your stress in your neck these days, this exercise will give you much-needed relief. Turn your head at a 45-degree angle, and pucker your lips. Then, make a fist with the same hand as the side of the neck that you're stretching, and use your knuckles to gently move from your jaw down to your neckline. Repeat on the other side.</figure>
